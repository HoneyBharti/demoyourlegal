                            Saudi Arabia's construction and real estate sector is at the heart of its Vision 2030 transformation, with trillions of dollars being invested in giga-projects like NEOM, the Red Sea Project, and Diriyah Gate. For contractors, developers, and consulting engineers, this presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity. However, success in this sector requires navigating an exceptionally complex financial and regulatory environment. It demands sophisticated project accounting to manage costs against budgets, adherence to rules set by the Real Estate General Authority (REGA), and flawless compliance with ZATCA's regulations on VAT and withholding tax for subcontractors. Standard accounting is completely inadequate for the scale and complexity of these projects. This guide covers the essential accounting services required to succeed in the Saudi construction and real estate market.

                            <p>From the moment you bid on your first project, specialized construction accounting is essential. It becomes non-negotiable at these stages:</p>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                                <li><strong>During the Bidding Process:</strong> To accurately estimate project costs and prepare a competitive, profitable bid.</li>
                                <li><strong>Upon Winning a Contract:</strong> To set up a detailed project budget, chart of accounts, and system for tracking all costs, including labor, materials, and subcontractor fees.</li>
                                <li><strong>When Dealing with Subcontractors:</strong> You must manage contracts, verify invoices, and correctly apply withholding tax on payments to foreign subcontractors.</li>
                                <li><strong>When Invoicing the Client:</strong> All invoices must be ZATCA-compliant e-invoices, and revenue must be recognized based on project completion milestones (percentage-of-completion method).</li>
                                <li><strong>During a Project Audit:</strong> Major clients, especially government-related ones, will conduct audits. Clean, transparent, and detailed project accounts are essential for passing these audits and getting paid.</li>

                            <p>The cost of professional project accounting reflects the high complexity and critical importance of financial control in construction.</p>

                                <li><strong>Small to Medium Projects:</strong> SAR 15,000 - SAR 40,000 per month. This covers project bookkeeping, cost tracking, subcontractor payment management, and monthly progress reporting.</li>
                                <li><strong>Large-Scale or Giga-Projects:</strong> Custom pricing starting from SAR 40,000+, involving a dedicated on-site or remote team, advanced project management software integration, and full-scope virtual CFO support.</li>

                                <li><strong>Project Cost Overruns:</strong> Without tight financial control, projects can easily go over budget, wiping out profitability.</li>
                                <li><strong>ZATCA Violations:</strong> Incorrectly handling VAT on construction contracts or failing to apply withholding tax on subcontractor payments can lead to massive penalties.</li>
                                <li><strong>REGA Non-Compliance:</strong> For developers, failing to adhere to off-plan sales regulations and escrow account rules can result in fines and license suspension.</li>
                                <li><strong>Contractual Disputes:</strong> Inaccurate cost records can weaken your position in disputes with clients or subcontractors over payments and variations.</li>

                            <p>Construction accounting is a highly specialized field. Most general accountants lack the expertise in project cost management, percentage-of-completion revenue recognition, and the specific tax rules for the construction industry in Saudi Arabia. Hiring a full-time project finance team is a major undertaking.</p>
                            <p className="mt-4">
                                Outsourcing to YourLegal's construction finance partners provides immediate access to a team that understands the Saudi market. We implement robust project accounting systems that give you real-time visibility into the financial health of every project.
