            <ContentSection title="Who This Service Is For">
                <p>This service is for all Dutch B.V. companies. It ensures that the mandatory annual financial statements (jaarrekening) are prepared correctly according to Dutch GAAP and filed with the Chamber of Commerce (KVK), and that the corporate income tax return is filed with the Dutch tax authorities (Belastingdienst).</p>
            </ContentSection>
            
             <ContentSection title="When It Is Required">
                <p>Annual accounts must be prepared within 5 months of the financial year-end and filed with the KVK within 12 months. The corporate income tax return must generally be filed within 5 months of the financial year-end, though extensions are often possible.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Cost Ranges">
                <p>The costs for annual compliance are for professional services to prepare the required documents:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Annual Accounts Preparation & Filing:** €600 – €1,500 for a typical small B.V.</li>
                    <li>**Corporate Income Tax Return:** €400 – €1,000.</li>
                    <li>**Bundled Packages:** Most providers, including YourLegal, offer a combined package for greater efficiency.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>Failure to meet annual filing deadlines can result in:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Fines:** The Belastingdienst can issue fines for late tax filings, and the KVK can penalize late filing of annual accounts.</li>
                    <li>**Director Liability:** In case of bankruptcy, directors can be held personally liable if annual accounts were not filed correctly and on time.</li>
                    <li>**Reputational Damage:** Public records at the KVK will show the company is non-compliant, which can harm relationships with banks, suppliers, and customers.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

             <ContentSection title="Why Outsourcing Works Better">
                <p>Dutch accounting standards and tax laws are specific and require local expertise. Outsourcing to YourLegal ensures your financial statements are prepared correctly by qualified accountants and that all KVK and tax deadlines are met. This protects the company and its directors from financial penalties and legal liability.</p>
