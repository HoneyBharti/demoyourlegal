                            The Netherlands' service-driven economy and strategic position in Europe make it an excellent base for consultants and professional service firms. The business model of selling expertise is highly effective, but it comes with specific financial management needs, particularly when operating across EU borders. Profitability depends on efficient time tracking, accurate project costing, and navigating the Dutch tax system, including BTW (VAT) rules for services. Standard bookkeeping is often insufficient to provide the strategic insights needed to run a profitable service business while ensuring full compliance with the Belastingdienst (Dutch Tax Authority). This guide details the specialized accounting and tax services essential for consultants and professional service firms to succeed in the Netherlands.
