            <ContentSection title="Mistake #1: Ignoring Transfer Pricing">
                <p>This is the most dangerous mistake. If your US company transacts with a foreign parent or subsidiary, you cannot simply charge whatever you want. Prices must be at "arm's length." Failing to create and document a transfer pricing policy can lead to severe IRS penalties and double taxation.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #2: Incorrect Withholding Tax Application">
                 <p>Failing to withhold the correct amount of tax (or any tax at all) on payments like dividends and royalties to foreign owners is a major compliance failure. The US company can be held liable for the unpaid tax, plus interest and penalties.</p>
            </ContentSection>
            
            <ContentSection title="Mistake #3: Neglecting Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)">
                 <p>If your US company has financial interest or signature authority over foreign bank accounts with a total value over $10,000, you must file an FBAR with FinCEN. This is separate from your tax return, and penalties for failure to file are severe.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #4: Poor Multi-Currency Management">
                 <p>Recording all transactions in a single currency without properly accounting for foreign exchange gains and losses can distort your financial statements and lead to incorrect tax calculations.
