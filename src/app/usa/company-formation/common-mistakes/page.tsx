            <ContentSection title="Mistake #1: Choosing the Wrong Entity Type">
                <p>This is the most critical and hardest-to-fix mistake. Choosing an LLC when you plan to raise venture capital creates a huge roadblock, as VCs only invest in C-Corps. Conversely, choosing a C-Corp for a simple consulting business can lead to unnecessary tax complexity ("double taxation"). Your long-term goals must dictate your entity choice.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #2: Choosing the Wrong State">
                 <p>While Delaware and Wyoming are excellent choices for most non-residents, a business with a physical presence (like an office or employees) in another state (e.g., California or New York) may be required to register there, subjecting it to that state's high taxes and regulations. Understanding "nexus" is key.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #3: Skipping Post-Incorporation Steps">
                 <p>Receiving your state formation certificate is the beginning, not the end. Many DIY founders fail to complete critical post-incorporation steps like adopting bylaws, issuing founder stock, or holding an initial board meeting. This can render the company a legal "shell" and jeopardize the liability protection.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #4: Incorrectly Applying for an EIN">
                 <p>For non-residents without an SSN, obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN) requires a manual application via Form SS-4. Errors on this form can lead to rejection and months of delays, preventing you from opening a bank account.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #5: Using a Home Address on Public Filings">
                 <p>Your company's formation documents are public record. Using your home address instead of a professional Registered Agent and mailing address service exposes your personal information and sacrifices privacy.</p>
