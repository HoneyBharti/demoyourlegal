                <p>The moment you start offering a product or service, you expose yourself to liability. If you operate without a formal entity (as a sole proprietor), your personal assets are at risk. Forming an LLC or C-Corp creates a legal "shield" and is the most important reason to incorporate as soon as you begin any business activity.</p>

                 <p>To open a US business bank account and accept payments from customers through platforms like Stripe, you need a registered US company and a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). For non-resident founders, forming a company is the critical first step to accessing the US financial system.</p>

                 <p>If you plan to hire a team in the US, you must have a legal business entity to enter into employment contracts and run a compliant payroll system. You cannot hire employees as an individual sole proprietor in most cases.</p>

            <ContentSection title="To Raise Capital from Investors">
                 <p>Investors do not invest in people; they invest in companies. If you plan to seek funding from angel investors or venture capitalists, you must have an incorporated entity (specifically a Delaware C-Corp) in which they can purchase equity.
