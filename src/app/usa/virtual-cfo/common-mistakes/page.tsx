            <ContentSection title="Mistake #1: Confusing Profit with Cash">
                <p>The most fatal financial mistake a founder can make. Your income statement can show a profit, but if your clients haven't paid you yet, you have no cash in the bank to make payroll. A Virtual CFO instills the discipline of focusing on the Statement of Cash Flows and managing cash runway above all else.</p>
            </ContentSection>
            
            <ContentSection title="Mistake #2: Top-Down, Unrealistic Forecasting">
                 <p>Investors immediately dismiss forecasts that say, "The market is $100 billion, and we'll capture 1%." A vCFO builds a credible, 'bottom-up' forecast based on tangible drivers like marketing spend, conversion rates, and sales team quotas. This creates a defensible operating plan, not a wild guess.</p>
            </ContentSection>
            
            <ContentSection title="Mistake #3: Not Understanding Unit Economics">
                 <p>Scaling a business without understanding your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Lifetime Value (LTV) is like pouring gasoline on a fire. A vCFO provides detailed analysis to ensure your growth is profitable and sustainable, preventing you from spending more to acquire customers than they are worth.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #4: Setting Prices Based on 'Gut Feel'">
                 <p>Pricing is one of the most powerful growth levers, yet many founders set it without any data. A vCFO analyzes your gross margins, costs, and the value you provide to help you build a data-driven pricing strategy that maximizes revenue and profitability.

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #5: Neglecting Scenario Planning">
                <p>Many founders only plan for the best-case scenario. A vCFO runs multiple scenarios (e.g., base case, worst case) to understand how different market conditions could impact cash flow. This allows the company to build contingency plans and be prepared for downturns.</p>

                <p>A Virtual CFO is the strategic partner who prevents these mistakes. They bring the financial rigor, forecasting tools, and analytical mindset needed to transform your financial function from a reactive chore into a proactive, strategic weapon for growth.</p>
