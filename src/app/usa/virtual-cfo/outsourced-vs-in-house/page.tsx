A vCFO service typically costs between $30,000 to $100,000 per year, providing a similar or higher level of strategic insight without the overhead." },

                <p>A traditional, full-time CFO is a W-2 employee and a member of your executive team. They are responsible for the entire finance function. However, this comes at a tremendous cost. In the US, an experienced CFO's salary typically starts at $250,000, plus equity, benefits, and bonuses. For a startup or growth-stage company, this is a massive fixed cost that consumes valuable cash runway.</p>

                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> You can easily scale the service up during a fundraise and down during a quieter period, a flexibility you don't have with a full-time employee.</li>
