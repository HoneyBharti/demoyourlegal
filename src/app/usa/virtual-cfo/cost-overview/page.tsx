            <ContentSection title="Typical Cost Ranges for vCFO Services">
                <p>Virtual CFO services are a strategic investment in your company's growth and fundraising success. The pricing reflects the high level of expertise and direct involvement provided. Costs are typically structured as a monthly retainer:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Strategic Advisory (for Seed Stage):</strong> $2,500 – $4,000 per month. This often includes building the initial financial model, establishing KPIs, and monthly check-ins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Active Management (for Series A):</strong> $4,000 – $8,000 per month. This includes full ownership of the financial model, preparing monthly board reports, managing cash flow, and providing support during fundraising.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intensive Support (Series B+ or M&A):</strong> $8,000+ per month. This involves deep strategic involvement, direct participation in board meetings, and leading the financial due diligence process for major transactions.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>
            
            <ContentSection title="What Drives the Cost?">
                 <p>The cost of a vCFO service is driven by the time and expertise required:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Stage of Business:</strong> A later-stage company with more complex operations and reporting requirements will require a higher level of service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fundraising Activity:</strong> A company actively fundraising requires significantly more support for model-building, due diligence, and scenario analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reporting Cadence:</strong> The frequency and depth of board and investor reporting impacts the monthly workload.</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Management:</strong> A vCFO managing an internal finance team will have a higher level of engagement.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>
            
            <ContentSection title="The Value Proposition: A Clear ROI">
                 <p>While the monthly cost is significant, it's crucial to compare it to the alternative: a full-time, in-house CFO, whose fully-loaded cost can easily exceed $300,000 per year. A vCFO provides the same or better strategic output for a fraction of the price.</p>
                 <p className="mt-4">Moreover, a good vCFO service pays for itself. Their expertise in financial modeling can help secure a higher valuation in a funding round, their cash flow management can extend runway by months, and their strategic analysis can identify opportunities for profitable growth, delivering a return on investment that far exceeds their fee.</p>
