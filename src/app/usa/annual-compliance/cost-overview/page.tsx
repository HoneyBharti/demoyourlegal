                    <li><strong>Delaware Franchise Tax:</strong> A flat $300 annual tax for LLCs. For C-Corps, it starts at $175 but can be higher depending on the number of authorized shares.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wyoming Annual Report:</strong> A fee of approximately $62, due on the anniversary of your company's formation.</li>

                 <p>This is the fee paid to a service provider like YourLegal to manage and file your compliance documents. Our Vitals and Elite plans bundle this service with tax preparation and bookkeeping for a predictable annual fee, providing significant value compared to paying separate providers for each service.</p>

             <ContentSection title="The Value of a Compliance Service">
                <p>While there is a cost to our service, it acts as an insurance policy against much larger costs. A single missed deadline can result in penalties that are several times the cost of an annual compliance plan. Our service automates this process, giving you peace of mind and allowing you to focus on your business.</p>
