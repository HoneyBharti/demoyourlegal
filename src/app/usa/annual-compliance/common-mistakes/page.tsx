            <ContentSection title="Mistake #1: Confusing State and Federal Filings">
                <p>The most frequent error is assuming that filing a federal tax return with the IRS covers all obligations. It does not. Your State Annual Report is a separate filing owed to your state of incorporation (e.g., Delaware) with a different deadline. You must file both to remain compliant.</p>
            </ContentSection>
            
            <ContentSection title="Mistake #2: Forgetting Critical Deadlines">
                 <p>Unlike the well-known April 15th tax deadline, state annual report deadlines vary. The Delaware C-Corp Franchise Tax is due March 1st. The Delaware LLC Annual Tax is due June 1st. Wyoming reports are due on the anniversary of formation. It's easy to miss these varied dates, leading to automatic penalties.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #3: Letting the Registered Agent Lapse">
                 <p>Every US company must maintain a Registered Agent. If you fail to renew your Registered Agent service, you will not receive official state notices, will fall out of good standing, and your company can be dissolved by the state.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #4: Ignoring the BOI Report">
                 <p>While not an 'annual' filing for most, the new mandatory Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) Report must be filed with FinCEN. Companies formed in 2024 have 90 days to file. Forgetting this new requirement carries a severe $500-per-day penalty.</p>
