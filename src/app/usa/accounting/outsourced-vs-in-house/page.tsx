            <ContentSection title="The In-House Model: High Cost, High Control">
                <p>Hiring an in-house accountant or finance team gives you a dedicated resource that is fully immersed in your company culture. However, this comes at a significant cost: salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, office space, and software licenses. For a small business, the salary of a single qualified accountant (often $70,000+) can be a major financial burden.</p>

            <ContentSection title="The Outsourced Model: Expertise on Demand">
                 <p>Outsourcing your accounting provides access to a full team of experts—bookkeepers, accountants, and CFOs—for a single, predictable monthly fee. This model offers several key advantages:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Dramatically lower costs compared to hiring a full-time employee.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access to Expertise:</strong> You benefit from a team with a breadth of experience across many industries and company stages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The service can easily scale up or down as your business needs change, without the need for hiring or firing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> It frees up founders and management to focus on core business activities, not administrative tasks.</li>

            <ContentSection title="Why Outsourcing is the Modern Choice">
                 <p>For most startups and small to medium-sized businesses, the choice is clear. The outsourced accounting model provides a higher level of service and expertise at a lower cost, with greater flexibility. It allows a small company to have a world-class finance function from day one, a crucial advantage in a competitive market.</p>
