            <ContentSection title="Venture Capital Investment">
                <p>This is the most common trigger for startups. Almost all institutional venture capital funds include a clause in their financing agreements that requires the company to provide audited annual financial statements. This provides the VCs with assurance over the accuracy of your financial reporting and helps them with their own fund valuation.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Bank Covenants">
                 <p>When securing a significant business loan or line of credit, banks will often include a "loan covenant" in the agreement that mandates the submission of audited financials each year. This helps the bank monitor the company's financial health and its ongoing ability to repay the debt.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Preparation for M&A or IPO">
                 <p>If you are planning to sell your company or take it public, you will need several years of audited financial statements. A potential buyer or underwriter will require this as a core part of their due diligence process. Many companies proactively undergo audits for 1-2 years before a planned exit event.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Regulatory Requirements">
                 <p>While most private companies are not legally required to be audited, certain regulated industries are. This can include financial services companies (e.g., broker-dealers), insurance companies, and non-profits that receive a certain amount of government funding.

             <ContentSection title="The Bottom Line: It's Driven by Stakeholders">
                <p>For most startups and SMBs, the need for an audit is not dictated by a general law, but by the specific demands of your investors, lenders, or potential acquirers. Review your financing agreements and loan covenants to understand your specific obligations. Our audit support service prepares you to meet these demands with confidence.</p>
