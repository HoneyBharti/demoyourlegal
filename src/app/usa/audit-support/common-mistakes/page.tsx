            <ContentSection title="Mistake #1: Panicking and Responding Directly">
                <p>The worst thing to do upon receiving an audit notice is to immediately call the auditor yourself. Anything you say can be used to expand the scope of the audit. The first step should always be to calmly contact your professional representative (CPA or tax attorney).</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #2: Providing More Information Than Requested">
                 <p>Auditors will provide a specific list of documents they need. Do not volunteer extra information, additional years of records, or unsolicited explanations. Stick strictly to what is asked for to keep the audit focused and prevent it from expanding into other areas.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #3: Having Disorganized or Incomplete Records">
                 <p>An audit is a test of your record-keeping. If your books are a mess and you can't produce receipts or invoices to support your deductions, the process will be painful and the outcome will likely be unfavorable. Clean, well-organized books are your best defense.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Mistake #4: Not Having Professional Representation">
                 <p>Attempting to handle an audit on your own is a major risk. A professional representative understands the process, knows how to interact with auditors, and can argue technical points on your behalf. They act as a crucial buffer between you and the auditing body.</p>
            </ContentSection>

             <ContentSection title="The Solution: Year-Round Audit Readiness">
                <p>The best way to avoid audit mistakes is to be prepared before the audit ever begins. By using a professional accounting service all year, your books are always clean, reconciled, and documented. This "audit-ready" state transforms a potential crisis into a manageable administrative process.</p>
