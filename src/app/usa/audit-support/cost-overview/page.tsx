            <ContentSection title="The Cost of the Audit Itself">
                <p>It's important to first understand that the audit itself is performed by an independent, third-party CPA firm, and their fees are separate from our audit support services. For a typical small or medium-sized business, a first-year financial statement audit can cost anywhere from **$20,000 to $50,000+**. This cost is heavily influenced by the complexity of your business and the quality and organization of your financial records.</p>

            <ContentSection title="The Value of Audit Support">
                 <p>Audit support services are designed to make the formal audit process as smooth and cost-effective as possible. By ensuring your books are clean, reconciled, and well-documented *before* the auditors begin, you can dramatically reduce the number of hours they need to spend, thereby lowering their fees. Our audit support includes:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li>Ensuring your financials are GAAP-compliant.</li>
                    <li>Preparing the detailed schedules and reports requested on the auditor's "Provided by Client" (PBC) list.</li>
                    <li>Acting as the primary point of contact to answer auditor questions.</li>
                    <li>Helping to resolve any potential issues or disagreements that arise during the audit.</li>

                    <li>**Vitals Plan:** Provides "audit-ready" financials. This means your books will be clean and GAAP-compliant, making the audit process much easier than starting from scratch.</li>
