                <p>The cost of business tax preparation depends on the complexity of your company's structure and activities. Our tax compliance service is included as part of our Vitals and Elite plans, providing excellent value. If purchased standalone from traditional firms, you could expect:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Standard Federal & State Filing (e.g., Form 1120 or 1065):</strong> $1,000 – $2,500</li>
                    <li><strong>Filing with International Forms (e.g., Form 5472):</strong> $1,500 – $3,500+ due to the increased complexity and risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-State Filings:</strong> Each additional state income tax return can add $300 - $600 to the total cost.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>
            
            <ContentSection title="What Drives the Cost?">
                 <p>Several factors influence the price of tax preparation:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Quality of Bookkeeping:</strong> The primary driver. If your books are messy and unreconciled, the tax preparer must first perform costly cleanup work before they can even begin the tax return.</li>
                    <li><strong>Entity Complexity:</strong> A C-Corp return is often more complex than a standard partnership return.</li>
                    <li><strong>International Activity:</strong> The need to file forms like 5472 or report foreign bank accounts (FBAR) significantly increases the scope and cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>State Nexus:</strong> The number of states where you have a filing obligation directly impacts the total cost.</li>
                </ul>
