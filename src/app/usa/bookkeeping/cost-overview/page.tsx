            <ContentSection title="Typical Cost Ranges">
                <p>The cost of outsourced bookkeeping is primarily driven by the volume of your financial activity. Here are some typical monthly ranges for businesses in the US:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Pre-Revenue Startups / Very Low Volume:</strong> $200 – $400 per month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small Businesses & Early-Stage Startups:</strong> $400 – $800 per month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growing Companies / E-commerce Stores:</strong> $800 – $1,500+ per month.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>
            
            <ContentSection title="What's Included in the Price?">
                 <p>A typical monthly bookkeeping package includes:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li>Setup of your Chart of Accounts in professional accounting software (like QuickBooks or Xero).</li>
                    <li>Automated daily import of all bank and credit card transactions.</li>
                    <li>Monthly categorization of all transactions.</li>
                    <li>Monthly reconciliation of all accounts.</li>
                    <li>Delivery of standard financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet).</li>

            <ContentSection title="The Value Proposition: Cost vs. Value">
                 <p>While DIY might seem cheaper, professional bookkeeping provides significant ROI. The cost of one incorrectly filed tax return and the resulting IRS penalties can easily exceed a full year of bookkeeping fees. Furthermore, accurate financial data empowers you to make smarter decisions, and the time you save by not doing it yourself can be reinvested into growing your business.</p>
