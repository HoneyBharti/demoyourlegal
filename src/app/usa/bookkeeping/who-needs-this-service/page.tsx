                <p>Even before you earn your first dollar, you're spending money. Software subscriptions, legal fees, and marketing expenses must all be meticulously tracked. Proper bookkeeping ensures these early costs are correctly recorded so they can be deducted against future revenue, improving your tax efficiency down the line.</p>

            <ContentSection title="E-commerce & Online Businesses">
                 <p>E-commerce businesses have high transaction volumes and complex costs, including inventory, shipping, payment processor fees, and marketing spend. Professional bookkeeping is essential to accurately calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), track profit margins, and manage cash flow effectively.

                 <p>For service-based businesses, time is money. Bookkeeping frees up valuable hours that are better spent on billable client work. It also ensures all business-related expenses, from home office costs to travel, are correctly documented and deducted, maximizing your take-home pay.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Foreign-Owned US Companies">
                 <p>Non-resident founders have specific and strict reporting requirements with the IRS. Clean bookkeeping is absolutely essential to track transactions between the US company and its foreign owners, which is required for mandatory filings like Form 5472. Failure here results in severe penalties.
