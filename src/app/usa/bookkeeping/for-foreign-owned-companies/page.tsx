            <ContentSection title="The Core Challenge: Tracking Related-Party Transactions">
                <p>For a US company owned by a non-resident, standard bookkeeping is not enough. The IRS has a special set of rules designed to monitor the flow of money between a US entity and its foreign owners. The most important of these is the requirement to file Form 5472, which details all "reportable transactions" between the two parties.</p>
                <p className="mt-2">This means your bookkeeping system must not only track income and expenses, but must specifically identify every transaction that involves the foreign owner. This includes:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li>Initial and subsequent capital contributions from the owner.</li>
                    <li>Loans made to or from the owner.</li>
                    <li>Payments for services rendered by the owner.</li>
                    <li>Reimbursements for expenses paid by the owner on behalf of the company.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>
            
            <ContentSection title="Why It's a High-Stakes Game">
                 <p>The penalty for failing to file an accurate Form 5472 is a staggering **$25,000**. This makes proper bookkeeping a critical risk management function for any foreign-owned US company. Without a meticulous record of all related-party transactions, accurately preparing this form is impossible.
